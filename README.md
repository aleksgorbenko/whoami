# Who am I?

A `00000001` about myself and my past experiences.

This is a living document that summarises my past life and work experiences, presented in reverse chronological order, similar to a resume.

While this is not strictly a resume, it is a story I want to share about my path that has led me to where I am today (see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleks-gorbenko-software-engineer) for a more detailed look at my career).

## 👨🏻‍🦲 2016 - Present: Software Engineer

Over the years, I have had the pleasure of working for several London-based companies in fintech, live-stream video and employee engagement sectors and growing professionally:

- Junior Engineer to Senior Engineer in 3.5 years
- Senior Engineer to Team Lead in the next 2.5 years

I was fortunate to work with many talented engineers and non-engineers, many of whom became my mentors and close friends.

In my role as a Team Lead, I managed a fully remote team of 8 engineers across 7 nationalities, managing 3 finTech products for UK-based banks and financial institutions. These systems were deployed in Kubernetes and designed as distributed microservices architectures.

After this experience, I embarked on a self-improvised [sabbatical](#sabbatical) to reflect and think about my next steps.

#### ➕ Skill Progression

- ✅ Team Leadership
- ✅ Payment Systems, Real-time video streaming
- ✅ Technologies: Go, Java, Spring, AWS, Postgres, Redis, Terraform, Helm, Git and others
- ✅ Distributed Systems, Microservice Architecture

#### Sabbatical

During the sabbatical for about 3 months, I took care of some of the health issues, read lots of books and completed 2 pilgrimages:

- Shikoku Henro Pilgrimage (四国遍路), Japan
  - I took many longer alternative paths and did an extension to this pilgrimage, which totalled to [~1775km and ~30km elevation gain](https://www.strava.com/athletes/142821511) in 53 days.
- El Camino Frances + Fisterre Pilgrimage, Spain
  - Walked a total of [~1000km and ~14km elevation gain]((https://www.strava.com/athletes/142821511))

Those were some of the most epic adventures I've had to date, with a number of personal breakthroughs, valuable life lessons, decisions made, and countless blisters on my feet.

## 🌐 2014 - 2016: SEO & First Taste of Web Development

While working at the hotel, I quite randomly went for a hackathon. I was quite into bodybuilding at the time and had an idea related to that to pitch. My idea even got shortlisted, but I failed to attract the interest of developers who were at the hackathon to join my group, so we couldn't build anything. With the team disbanded, I joined another team where I met someone who ran an SEO Agency. I asked if I could come and work for them, and to my amazement, they agreed. I had no clue what SEO meant at the time, or how the web worked, but I learned pretty fast. The more I learned, the more I found myself enjoying doing the technical side of things, which eventually led me to enrol on an online [coding bootcamp](https://aleksgorbenko.dev/firehose-project-week-1/).

After finishing the bootcamp, I spent 3 months searching for a new role. I went to a job fair, from which I ended up with 2 offers for a Junior Software Engineer position. This taught me the importance of a face-to-face interaction and networking. I blogged about my search [here](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/lessons-from-my-post-bootcamp-job-search-in-london-cb37ea12ec2f).

#### ➕ Skill Progression

- ✅ Web Development Fundamentals & SEO
- ✅ Coding
- ✅ Client Management

## 🍽️ 2010 - 2014: Luxury Hospitality

I studied Hotel and Tourism Management, and worked in between the semesters at prestigious 5-star hotels and 3-star Michelin restaurants in the UK. The career prospects were promising, but shortly after moving to London for my Manager-in-Training, I decided to drop out and leave the industry. I had no plan and no idea what I was doing

#### ➕ Skill Progression

- ✅ Communication Ability
- ✅ Working in high-pressure environments

## 👦🏻 Early Life

Born in Riga, Latvia. Growing up, I was a nerdy kid who got my first computer at 13 years old. I broke it consistently and had to re-install Windows more times than I can remember. I had the reputation of the "IT guy" in school.

I played ice hockey for 11 years, which taught me the values of trust in the team, camaraderie, accountability and self-sacrifice. Upon reflection in adulthood, I think those experiences shaped me in many ways I am today.

## 🙊 Fun Facts

1️⃣ In 2017, I had a chance to ask 1 question to  ["Uncle Bob" Robert Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)), whom I met at the tech event in London. My question was:

**What would you advise a 25-year-old self who switched careers to become a Software Engineer?**

With a wise and friendly smile, he replied:

> Find a mentor

I follow this advice to this day. In life and work.

2️⃣ I probably became fluent in English by playing World of Warcraft. I will be forever grateful to my grandma for investing in my extra English lessons from an early age.
