# Who am I?

A 00000001 about myself and my past experiences.

This is a living document that summarises my past life and work experiences, presented in reverse chronological order, similar to a resume. While this is not strictly a resume, it is a story I want to share about my path that has led me to where I am today.

## 2016 - Present: Software Engineer

Over the years, I have had the pleasure of working for several London-based companies in fintech, live-stream video and employee engagement sectors and growing professionally:

- Junior Engineer to Senior Engineer in 3.5 years
- Senior Engineer to Team Lead in the next 2.5 years

I was fortunate to work with many talented engineers and non-engineers, many of whom became my mentors and close friends.

Last 1.5 years, I spent as a Team Lead managing a fully remote team of 8 people representing 7 nationalities. After which, I embarked on a self-improvised [sabbatical](#sabbatical) to reflect and think about my next steps.

##### Skill Progression

- Team Leadership
- Payment Systems, Real-time video streaming
- Technologies: Go, Java, Spring, AWS, Postgres, Redis, Terraform, Helm, Git and others

#### Sabbatical

During the sabbatical for about 3 months, I took care of some of the health issues, read lots of books and completed 2 pilgrimages:
- Shikoku Henro Pilgrimage (四国遍路), Japan
- I took many longer alternative paths and did an extension to this pilgrimage, which totalled to [~1775km and ~30km elevation gain](https://www.strava.com/athletes/142821511) in 53 days.
- El Camino Frances + Fisterre Pilgrimage, Spain
- Walked a total of [~1000km and ~14km elevation gain]((https://www.strava.com/athletes/142821511))

Those were some of the most epic adventures I've had to date, with a number of personal breakthroughs, valuable life lessons, decisions made, and countless blisters on my feet.

## 2014 - 2016: Digital Marketing & First Taste of Web Development

While working at the hotel, I quite randomly went for a hackathon. I was quite into bodybuilding at the time and had an idea related to that to pitch. My idea even got shortlisted, but I failed to attract the interest of developers who were at the hackathon to join my group, so we couldn't build anything. With the team disbanded, I joined another team where I met someone who ran an SEO Agency. I asked if I could come and work for them, and to my amazement, they agreed. I had no clue what SEO meant at the time, or how the web worked, but I learned pretty fast. The more I learned, the more I found myself enjoying doing the technical side of things, which eventually led me to enrol on an online coding bootcamp.

After finishing the bootcamp, I spent 3 months searching for a new role. I went to a job fair, from which I ended up with 2 offers for a Junior Software Engineer position. Thus, my current career has begun .

##### Skill Progression

- Web Development Fundamentals & SEO
- Coding
- Client Management

## 2010 - 2014: Luxury Hospitality

I studied Hotel and Tourism Management, and worked in between the semesters at prestigious 5-star hotels and 3-star Michelin restaurants in the UK. The career prospects were promising, but shortly after moving to London for my Manager-in-Training, I decided to drop out and leave the industry. I had no plan and no idea what I was doing

##### Skill Progression

- Communication Ability
- Working in high-pressure environments

## Early Life

Born in Riga, Latvia. Growing up, I was a nerdy kid who got my first computer at 13 years old. I broke it consistently and had to re-install Windows more times than I can remember. I had the reputation of the "IT guy" in school.

I played ice hockey for 11 years, which taught me the values of trust in the team, camaraderie, accountability and self-sacrifice. Upon reflection in adulthood, I think those experiences shaped me in many ways I am today.

## Fun Facts

1. In 2017, I had a chance to ask 1 question to "Uncle Bob" (Robert Cecil Martin), whom I met at the tech event in London. My question was: "What would you advise a 25-year-old self who switched careers to become a Software Engineer?"

With a wise and friendly smile, he replied:

> Find a mentor

I follow this advice to this day. In life and work.
